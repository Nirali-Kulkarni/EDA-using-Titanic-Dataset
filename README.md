# EDA-using-Titanic-Dataset

Initially I have explored the Titanic Dataset using Python's different libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikitlearn.
Then I build a ML classification model to predict if a passenger was survived or deceased. 
Accuracy of the ML classification model was 72.28%.
